# ZX_Basic_and_Assembly
# Project #1 : ZX NEXT OBJECTS
# ZX Spectrum NEXT Object-Oriented Environment for desktop apps with BASIC as a supportive background logic
# Idea is to load different objects on screen like Forms, TextBoxes and Buttons and make it possible to move them around using the mouse available in NEXT
# Basic will act as a background language to interact with these objects and provide certain automations.
# In order to run CSpect or other emulator is required, as well as original ZX Next hardware of course.
# MOUSE.drv and MOUSE.pal files should be added to the app folder from the DEMO/MOUSE folder of original distribution (not provided here).
# With the vast memory capabilities of Next and the resolution of Layer 1,2, I believe this project is promising.
# Any input is welcome since I am still trying to remember my BASIC since childhood, while taking little steps in learning Z80 Assembly.
# Ambitious project. However, still in its infancy.
