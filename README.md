# ZX_Basic_and_Assembly
# Project #1 : ZX NEXT OBJECTS
# ZX Spectrum NEXT Object-Oriented Environment for desktop apps with BASIC as a supportive background logic
# Idea is to load different objects on screen like Forms, TextBoxes and Buttons and make it possible to move them around using the mouse available in NEXT
# Basic will act as a background language to interact with these objects and provide certain automations.
# With the vast memory capabilities of Next, I believe this project is feasible.
# However, still in its infancy.
